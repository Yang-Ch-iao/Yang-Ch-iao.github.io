This paper proposes a joint model for multi-modal sarcasm detection, utilizing both local semantic-guided and global incongruity learning modules. It introduces a local semantic-guided incongruity learning module using IoU scores and ConceptNet5, and a global incongruity learning module based on attention mechanisms. The approach improves performance on sarcasm detection tasks by effectively addressing multimodal incongruity.
